# recipe_app

This repository contains my individual project submission for my senior inquiry at Augustana College.

## Description

My  simple recipe search application for Android. The user can search for a recipe by either typing in the full name of the dish, or by typing in an ingredient. The app uses the Edamam Recipe Search API, which stores various recipes from around the web and displays it in a web view.

## Tools and Dependencies

For this application, I used Android Studio 4.1.0.0 running on Windows 10. For the user interface and web interaction, I used the latest versions of Dart and Flutter UI, which at the time of this application's completion, are 201.9335 and 55.0.1, respectively. Both can be installed from within Android Studio by going to File -> Settings -> Plugins.
